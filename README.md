# Numerical Implementation of GRAPE Algorithm for Optimal Quantum State Transfer in a Single Qubit System
In this project, I implemented the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm to optimize quantum control pulses for a single qubit system. My objective was to find time-dependent control fields that drive a qubit from a known initial state to a desired target state with high fidelity.
